= JaCoCo-GWT Maven Plugin

This plugin makes it possible to collect and report on test coverage
from tests that extend GWTTestCase.

== Setup

Add the following to the `<plugins>` section of your pom.xml:

[source,xml]
------
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.jboss.errai</groupId>
  <artifactId>jacoco-gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.4.201202141554</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>jacoco-initialize</id>
      <phase>initialize</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <propertyName>jacocoArgs</propertyName>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
    <execution>
      <id>jacoco-site</id>
      <phase>site</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>report</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
------

And add this to the `<configuration>` section of `maven-surefire-plugin`:

[source,xml]
------
<argLine>${jacocoArgs} ${argLine}</argLine>
------

(the default for `<argLine>` is `${argLine}`, so it's best to include
that when you modify the settings. This JaCoCo plugin doesn't require
it, so feel free to omit `${argLine}` if you need to.)

== How to use it

=== Collect Test Coverage Data

[source]
------
% mvn test
------

JaCoCo will record its coverage information into `target/jacoco.exec`
as usual, and our agent will record snapshots of GWTTestCase's
runtime-modified classes under `target/snapshot-classes` (but this
isn't important unless you care how it works).

=== Report on the Collected Data

[source]
------
% mvn site               # (for the full project site; see site-maven-plugin)
  - or -
% mvn jacoco-gwt:report  # (for just the JaCoCo HTML report)
------

JaCoCo will create a bunch of HTML pages that outline code coverage,
including coverage in client-side code that was exercised by
GWTTestCases. Find these reports under `target/site/jacoco`.

NOTE: For client-side-only classes that are exercised by both unit
tests and GWTTestCases, only the coverage from the GWTTestCases will
be included in the report. The coverage information from both types of
tests exists in jacoco.exec, but the reporting gives precedence to the
GWTTestCase coverage.


== How This Plugin Works

Note: you don't need to read this part to use the plugin. It's just
here for the sake of interest.

JaCoCo works in two phases:

. While code is running, a Java Agent records the hash of classes as
they are loaded, then instruments those classes to log information
about which code was executed. This information is typically appended
to a file called `jacoco.exec` when the VM shuts down.

. At some later time, the JaCoCo reporting tool reads the
`jacoco.exec` file and attempts to read the associated .class files
from the project's classpath. If the class files it finds don't match
the hash that was computed by the agent in step 1, the reporting tool
ignores the coverage information for that class (it assumes the
classes have been recompiled, so the branches and line numbers won't
necessarily match up anymore).

The crux of the problem between GWTTestCase and vanilla JaCoCo is that
GWTTestCase uses a ClassLoader that modifies .class files as they are
loaded. Unfortunately, this happens _before_ the JaCoCo agent gets a
chance to record the hash of the raw on-disk class file. When step 2
comes around, JaCoCo's reporting tool notices the mismatch in class
file contents, and ignores all the client-side code that was modified
by the GWTTestCase.

This plugin solves the problem by inserting a new Java Agent which
runs after GWTTestCase's ClassLoader and before JaCoCo's own
agent. This new agent simply saves GWT's modified version of the
.class file under the target/ directory. Then, with a small
modification to the reporting plugin, these "snapshot classes" are
included in the search for .class files when it comes time to build
the report.
